# Tennis Score Keeper

This is a simple & effective tennis score tracking application for iOS and watchOS. Android and 
wearOS are planned for the future.

# Scoring

A player needs to win four points to win a game, six games to win a set, and two or three sets to win a match. 
In order to win a game, players must win four points. The name of these four points is 15, 30, 40, and 
game, with the starting point, 0, being called love. If the game is tied at 40-40 (also known as deuce), 
the game continues until one player wins by a two-point lead. Players must win a set by two games and match 
by two sets.  if the score is 40-all (also called deuce), a player must win two points in a row to win the game. 
If the player serving wins one point, it’s called “Advantage In,” or add-in for short. If the receiving 
player wins a point, it’s called “Advantage Out,” or add-out. If the score is Ad-In (so the server won 
the point at deuce) and the server wins the point, then the server wins the game. If the score is Ad-Out 
(so the returner won the point at deuce) and the server wins the point, then the score goes back to deuce.
This cycle continues until one player wins two points in a row when the score is deuce.
